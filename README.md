Facebook isn’t just a social network. It helps you stay in touch with your friends, keep up with the news feed, promote your business, and so much more. But no matter how popular it is, sometimes Facebook doesn’t work, and it’s not always your fault.


## How to Fix ‘Facebook Not Working’ errors?
When you log into Facebook on either a mobile phone or a PC, and Facebook freezes suddenly, then the following are the steps you should take.


### 1. Reopen the App

We rarely close apps that keep running apps in the background. As a result, apps can take up RAM space on your phone, causing Facebook to stop working. But there is a simple way to tackle this problem.

Sometimes issues from the Facebook end can cause lags. Closing and reopening the messenger app can also remove the lags.

### 2. Check your internet connection

What to do when you can’t connect to Facebook because of an unstable network? Unfortunately, a poor network will always cause internet connectivity problems.

**Therefore, we recommend testing your internet connection if you notice your Facebook is not working.**

1. Check if the Wi-Fi on your mobile device is connected or not.
2. Turn off the flight mode if it’s on.
3. If you are not using Wi-Fi or Ethernet, first check if the Ethernet cable is connected.
4. You can go to other websites and applications on your smartphones to test if you can connect or not. If you cannot connect, fix network issues before attempting to log in to Facebook.



### 3. Can’t connect to Facebook, but the internet is working?

Firewalls may block you from accessing these websites. If you have a firewall program enabled on your PC. Then check the firewall settings. If Facebook is there on the blacklist, remove it from the list.

### 4. Facebook Server is down

**Still, wondering why is Facebook not working?**

* Sometimes the Facebook server can also go down. Although the Facebook server rarely goes down, you can solve this issue through simple verifications.

* You can visit the Facebook status checker hosted by the Facebook company if you want to verify that Facebook doesn’t have any problems.
